"None of us will ever accomplish anything excellent or commanding except when he listens to this whisper which is heard by him alone."

"The only person you are destined to become is the person you decide to be."

"Don't say things. What you are stands over you the while, and thunders so that I cannot hear what you say to the contrary."

-Ralph Waldo Emerson
