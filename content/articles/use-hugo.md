Hi everyone, it's been a very long while since I updated my website, but here it is.
It's mostly the same stylistically but with one major upgrade: I'm using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/).

What is HUGO?
So maybe you're like me and your first experience with navbars and dynamic web programming was PHP.
Angular? React? Same difference.
Essentially you used the overhead of JavaScript and/or server programming to determine what page view to serve the viewer.
HUGO, like many other static site generators, compiles markdown content to HTML with templating.
This makes it very easy to write while leveraging the ability to template that you would normally only get with full stack framework.
The fact that it's generated beforehand also means that your pages will load fast, because it doesn't have to ping a backend to retrieve content; it's already there and ready to go.

My experience with HUGO has been pretty good so far.
It's written in Golang, so compile times are pretty fast; for an incremental change it takes 3ms (not too shabby!).
It really didn't take that long to read the documentation and get my single page site to a multi-page blog.
Keep in mind, it may be faster for you to bring up a website if you're not obstinate like me and insist on creating your own CSS and HUGO theme.
That's right, you can download other people's themes and there are so many free ones online to suit your tastes.
I have plans to share my simple theme for anyone like me who just wants something simple but complete.
It may take a while but keep an eye out and subscribe to my [RSS](https://rudyghill.com/index.xml) (That's right, HUGO automatically generates an RSS feed).

I still have a lot of work to do, and in fact, I haven't really set up my spell check environment, so I may make some spelling errors in this first one.
But now, I can enjoy the simplicity of markdown files to write articles and posts (see my homepage).
If you're running an estore, or you need to do something server side with a database, of course use some backend programming.
But I say if you just want to start a personal blog, HUGO keeps it insanely simple.
Give it a try.
